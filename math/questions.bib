    abstract = { Abstract Current nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) deals with X = FGT type. We provide a systematic analysis and extensions of NMF to the symmetric W = HHT, and the weighted W = HSHT. We show that (1) W = HHT is equivalent to Kernel if-means clustering and the Laplacian-based spectral clustering. (2) X = FGT is equivalent to simultaneous clustering of rows and columns of a bipartite graph. Algorithms are given for computing these symmetric NMFs. }

abstract = {Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing (PLSI) have been successfully applied to document clustering recently. In this paper, we show that PLSI and NMF (with the I-divergence objective function) optimize the same objective function, although PLSI and NMF are different algorithms as verified by experiments. This provides a theoretical basis for a new hybrid method that runs PLSI and NMF alternatively, each jumping out of the local minima of the other method successively, thus achieving a better final solution. Extensive experiments on five real-life datasets show relations between NMF and PLSI, and indicate that the hybrid method leads to significant improvements over NMF-only or PLSI-only methods. We also show that at first-order approximation, NMF is identical to the Ï‡2-statistic.}
